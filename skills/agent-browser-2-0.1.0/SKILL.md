# agent-browser-2-0.1.0 (Reference Only)

## Purpose
This directory is a documentation/template snapshot for auditing and comparison.
It is **not** a runnable “pinned version” unless the runtime binary is also pinned.

## Important
This skill does NOT guarantee a specific agent-browser binary version.
If you need true version pinning, use Option B (pinned binary) and rename this skill accordingly.
