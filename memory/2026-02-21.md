# Session Notes - 2026-02-21

## Linode search routing stabilization

- Added wrapper command: `perplexity-search "your question"` for all web lookup tasks.
- Wrapper uses `mcporter` with the correct `messages` payload format and `search_context_size: high`.
- `message` tool is denied for `main` to prevent channel-target retry loops in webchat sessions.
- Cloud instructions now point to the wrapper command and explicitly forbid direct `mcporter` calls from model output.
