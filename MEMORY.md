# MEMORY.md - Vidar's Context

## Who You Are

**Vidar** (New Jersey) — father, small business owner, marketer, hobbyist developer, AI music creator. 

Operates **Shipster Brands / Mother Knitter**: yarn importing + wholesale network + brick-and-mortar + WooCommerce/WordPress ecommerce on Ubuntu.

**Cognitive style:** Thinks in systems and outcomes; tolerates complexity only when it earns its keep.

## Communication Preferences

- **Concise, structured, actionable responses** — skip fluff and clichés
- **Format:** Recommended path + brief tradeoffs + execution steps
- **Approach:** Make reasonable assumptions when info is missing

## Technical Preferences

- Rigorous reviews
- Simple, testable designs
- Performance + scalability awareness
- Minimal but meaningful admin settings
- **Strong documentation and developer handoffs**
- Regression testing

## Active Projects

### AI/RAG Ecommerce Chatbot
Developing a conversational chatbot grounded in store data (products, variants, inventory, policies).

### AI-Assisted Music/Songwriting
Creating music + lyrics with:
- Songwriter-style authenticity and imperfection
- Practical usability (including branding applications)
- Vigilance around legal + rights pitfalls

## Family Context

- **Daughter:** Charlie
- **Wife:** Laurie (passed away; navigating estate/probate)
- **Priority:** Family is central

## Growth Area

Working on communication habits — aiming to be warmer and less reactive.

## Working Arrangement

**Role:** Proactive development force multiplier. Vidar wants me to:
- Audit and improve his repos (code quality, tests, docs, scalability)
- Make AI-assisted development easier (clean patterns, testable)
- Create PRs for review (no pushing live)
- Keep a daily log in `memory/`

**GitHub Access:** PAT stored locally. Working on:
1. **photonest** (firebase-hosted node web app, photonest.ai, pre-monetization)
2. **tunetussle** (node multiplayer game, tunetussle.com, pre-monetization)
3. **mk-theme** (WordPress/WooCommerce theme, live at motherknitter.com)
4. **wpchat** (RAG chatbot for ecommerce, planned plugin)

**Strategy:** Help Vidar learn to build with AI tools by providing clean, testable, well-documented code.

## Infrastructure Notes

**Backups:** Handled by **ClawBackup** (not OpenClaw's built-in cron)
- Script: `backup_enhanced.sh` (generated by `setup.js`)
- Path: `~/clawd/scripts/backup_enhanced.sh`
- Scheduling:
  - macOS: LaunchAgent `com.openclaw.backup` in `~/Library/LaunchAgents/`
  - Linux: user cron entry
  - Windows: Task Scheduler
- Repo: https://github.com/vidarbrekke/ClawBackup

## Notes for Working Together

- Be direct and practical
- Assume Vidar has domain expertise in his areas — don't over-explain basics
- Flag assumptions if info is missing; don't guess
- Connect solutions to business/outcome impact
- Respect that family priorities shape scheduling and energy
- Log daily work in `memory/` — Vidar skims, not reads every word

## Error Handling Protocol (Learned 2025-01-30)

When responses fail silently (user asks why I didn't answer):

1. **Check session history for `stopReason: "error"`** — provider failures show as empty content + error status
2. **Don't assume I "skipped" it** — verify if Fireworks/OpenRouter returned errors
3. **Surface immediately** — if provider error confirmed, tell user: *"Provider error occurred — retrying"*
4. **Log pattern** — note if intermittent (infrastructure) vs repeatable (prompt-related)

Root cause of Jan 30 incident: Fireworks returned `Unknown error` twice; I failed to detect/report it.
